# APDOS
APDOS is a Denail Of Service Program developed by Sav-SEC / SAVAGEO.

# Basics
This is a extremely simple DDOS client.
It's main purpose is to show off the possibility
of denial of service from an iOS device running
Pythonista 3 (in a funny and weak). As time 
progresses I might make it stronger. Hello to all 
the NSA agents out there who might skim over this!

# Requirements
-A brain
-Python 2.4+
-Pythonista
-Wifi or Ethernet
-A 100 year old server
-And the ability to type

# ADD NUMBER TO SYS.ARGV[1] TO MULTIPLE STRENGTH FOR THE 'GREAT' ATTACK!
