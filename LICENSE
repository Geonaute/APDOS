       -+--=:=- Notise -=:=--+-
APDOS would never had existed without LOIC
(Low Orbit Ion Cannon). The funny idea of an off-topic 
loading screen for a DDoS/DoS client originates from LOIC.
And now APDOS is the strongest iOS DDoS Client.
(DDoS Attack Script is not made by LOIC)

     -+--=:=- Disclaimers -=:=--+-
Use APDOS at your own risk. DDoS/DoS attacks are 
illegal in most countries. For protection I recommend 
the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) at all times!
We the creators are not responsible for your choices or actions. 

I do not claim full credit for the 1st though 6th creations of the
base functionality of this client. I used scripts as a base to start 
and "modded" them [Legally] so it could function neatly as a whole 
with the other scripts. I will give this time to mention the creators 
of the base coding. Currently all the scripts do not fall under ownership
of any of the base creaters. All clients used in APDOS have undergone major
changes in code and software. The scripts are no where close to what they started
out as due to the mass amount of changes made by: SavSec. Most function 
completely differently then the base scripts so ownership of theses current
and future scripts now fall under ownership of SavageOfficial. If more then 30
MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY changes are made on these current or future scripts and if
they are approved by SavSec, then ownership of the current and future clients
that were publicly modded by a different developer, then the client will become
their ownership. Until your work has hit the 30+ major changes, then your copy
of these scripts will be mod versions and still under ownership of SavageOfficial.
THE FIRST SET SCRIPTS PUBLISHED HERE FALL UNDER OWNERSHIP OF OTHER DEVELOPERS.
ALL SCRIPTS AFTER THE 15+ UPDATE MARK ARE OWNED BY SAVSEC.

  NOTICE: The pure amount of force that apdos is today, was not made by NetArrivials.
  NetArrivials was the base script used to make the client able to send basic data.
  MORE THEN 50 CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE SCRIPT BY SAVSEC TO MAKE IT STRONGER AND NOW ONLY 10% OF THE SCRIPT IS TE SAME
  So I thank the developers there for making a small script that sends data.
  But SavSec is what made the script extremely powerful and new.
  So at this point the script doesn't have ownership to them, but the 1st-5th versions of UDPdos does.

APDOS intended use is to NON-MALISOUSLY attempt
Denial of Service on small servers as a stress test. 
(And by stating this it becomes legal to publish)

The intended program for this to run on is Pythonista 3 (c) 
from the AppSore; provided by Omz:Software (c) 2016. Not extended modules 
are required to run this version.

I hereby grant allowance to all who use this program, with the following:
-Allowed to change the script
-Allowed to alter use
-Allowed to republish if a significate amount of changes 
are applied to help improve or add to the functionality of the script as a whole
-Allowed to use (at their own risk)

I do NOT grant:
-Claiming ownership of the base script and current script
